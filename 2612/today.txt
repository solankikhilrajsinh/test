implement pagination using php
for example , like we are recording list of users inside table so here we have to do pagination ,
just store first 5 user input detail then from 6 it wil go to another page ,...

replace list.php with created list_pagination.php 


Applying oops concept
first create config.php file in that i have to make 
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "practice_one";
this all thing constant for all files and just include this file for all


after that have to create db.php file  in that i have to make
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
this all thing constant for all files and just include this file for all


created helper.php file in that all validate function are there so if in future if,
we require then we can use it as a reference
