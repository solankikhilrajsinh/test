like first user is register than its details go accordingly and after that we enter inside we can edit details like 
country,interests,about,document and also we can add new user from backend it details is also store and both data will show at list page



i made one database name practice_one inside that make two tables
(1) users
(2) user_details

like one db but contain multiple table like user enter his data so it will form and go accordingly to the table which it is located
here we have to use sql joins
