Today i have to work on two things like 
changepassword.php in that i have to gve two input new password,confirm password if both match then we will allow user to update
if both not match then we will throw an error like password does not match 

and this option i have to give in user list page  that is list.php 


give status option at view page , so by clicking button at time you can change Enabled/disabled users.
if active (1) then status 0 
if inactive(0) then status 1

study reference material for 
how to disable user if he/she is not using our site after login of 6 hr duration timestamp?
how to put code generator at login page?

after completing that work on w3schools exercise which was provided by them.
