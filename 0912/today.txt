apply bootstratp css to the Practice folder all file for better look

work with bootstrap css apply and use it in practice.php and implement in my existing work

create one forgotpassword.php in that if user forgot his password then we only take email address of that person and we generate otp like password using rand() function .
if we host our website then after we will get reset link at our personal mail id from that we can use it directly.
