today have to work on contact page
there first of all I have to create db in that I have to give 4 field
Name 
Email
Message
created_at

for this have to create one contact at menu page and implement ajax table in that


id -int(11)
name-varchar(100)
email-varchar(100)
message-varchar(1000)

now have to create pages for these
contact
contact_list
contact_add
contact_view
contact_Add


we have to set like that if any user go to hotel contact page and from there he/she will submit the data so it should be save in our db and display at admin dashboard page.


now have to implement ajax while we submitting form it is reloading page again so better apply ajax so at same place it will reload.


have to create disable/enable button at contact table so for that I have to make one more column at database status

now have to implement write query at contacts.php page if user touches the active then only active user should come if user touches inactive then inactive user should come 
so for that I create two id 
like 1. id="#active-example" 2. id="inactive-example" then have to write query inside that code only and one query at contact_list.php
